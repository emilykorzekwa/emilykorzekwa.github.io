            I have always found the lives of the saints fascinating. Each saint is unique, both in their background and how God acted in their lives. My goal for this series is to tell the story of a saint by connecting historical art styles of depicting saints, such as Eastern iconography, while also incorporating my own style. Each piece is based on researching the biography of the saint and previous images of that saint for the historical details and the symbols traditionally associated with the saint.

He carries a staff and wears a mitre to show that he was a bishop. Although there is little historical evidence of whether or not bishops wore the mitre in the 4th century, I decided to include it because it would more clearly communicate to modern viewers that he was a bishop, and not just a priest. His feast day is December 2nd.",
